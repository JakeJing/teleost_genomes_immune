Notes:
Files in this directory demonstrate scripts and data used for phylogenomic inference of teleost fishes, as described in Supplementary Notes S15-S17.

Software required:
bash (tested with GNU bash, version 3.2.57(1)-release (x86_64-apple-darwin14))
ruby (tested with ruby 2.0.0p481 (2014-05-08 revision 45883) [universal.x86_64-darwin14])
rscript (tested with R scripting front-end version 3.1.2 (2014-10-31))
python3 (tested with Python 3.4.0)
java (tested with java version "1.8.0_31")

Input files in data directory:
constraints/root_constraints.xml - set of topological constraints for BEAST analyses
constraints/fossil_constraints.xml - set of topological and divergence time constraints for BEAST analyses
nuclear/*.nex - alignment files produced as part of the S11_S14_ortholog_identification pipeline

Executing this pipeline:
cd [PATH]/S15_S17_phylogenetic_inference/scripts
bash start.sh
