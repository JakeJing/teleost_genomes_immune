Description: slouch provides functions for fitting macro evolutionary
models of trait evolution on a phylogeny as well as useful tree
plotting, parsimony reconstruction, iterated GLS regression 
functions for incorporating observation error of continuous 
variables, and bias correction functions for when predictor 
variable error biases regression slopes Macro evolutionary trait 
optima can be modeled as a single global optimum for all species, 
as a function of different fixed categorically encoded niches that 
can change over time for groups of species, as a multiple or 
single predictor regression on fixed, continuously encoded 
measures of other traits or the external environment,  as a 
multiple or single predictor regression on randomly evolving 
continuous measures of the external environment, or as any 
combination of the preceding models Observation error for any 
continuously measured variable, as well as more complex 
interactions between observation errors, such as covariances 
between response and predictor observation errors can be included 
in the model fitting functions
