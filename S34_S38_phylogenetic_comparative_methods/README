Notes:
Files in this directory demonstrate scripts and data used for the analysis of MHC I copy number evolution with phylogenetic comparative methods, as described in Supplementary Notes S34-S38.

Software required:
bash (tested with GNU bash, version 3.2.57(1)-release (x86_64-apple-darwin14))
ruby (tested with ruby 2.0.0p481 (2014-05-08 revision 45883) [universal.x86_64-darwin14])
rscript (tested with R scripting front-end version 3.1.2 (2014-10-31))

Input files in data directory:
tables/MHCU_boot.txt - bootstrapped copy number estimates for the MHC I U-lineage
tables/MHCZ_boot.txt - bootstrapped copy number estimates for the MHC I Z-lineage
tables/order.txt - list specifying the order in which species will be plotted in ancestral reconstruction figures
tables/species.txt - list translating species ids and names
trees/76g_nucl_conc_fossils.combined.tre - fossil-calibrated phylogenetic tree produced as part of the S15_S17_phylogenetic_inference pipeline

Executing this pipeline:
cd [PATH]/S34_S38_phylogenetic_comparative_methods/scripts
bash start.sh
