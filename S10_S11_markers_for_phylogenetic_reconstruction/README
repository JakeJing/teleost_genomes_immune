Notes:
Files in this directory demonstrate scripts and data used to identify a set of 2251 candidate exon markers to be used for phylogenomic analysis, as described in Supplementary Notes S10-S11.
Several files were removed from the data directory subsequent to the analysis due to space restrictions. These files are here replaced with a file with compressed information called "genes.dmp". In order to run the complete pipeline, please remove "genes.dmp", and place the files listed below in the data directory instead.

Software required:
bash (tested with GNU bash, version 3.2.57(1)-release (x86_64-apple-darwin14))
ruby (tested with ruby 2.0.0p481 (2014-05-08 revision 45883) [universal.x86_64-darwin14])
tblastn (tested with tblastn 2.2.26+)


Input files in data directory:
exons_from_biomart.txt - list of exon, transcript and gene ids for Danio rerio, obtained from http://www.ensembl.org/biomart on 04/12/14
Compara.78.protein.nhx.emf - ENSEMBL gene trees, obtained from http://www.ensembl.org/biomart on 04/12/14
