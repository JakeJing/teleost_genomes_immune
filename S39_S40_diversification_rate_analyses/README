Notes:
Files in this directory demonstrate scripts and data used for diversification rate analyses, including BiSSE analyses, as described in Supplementary Notes S39-S40.

Software required:
bash (tested with GNU bash, version 3.2.57(1)-release (x86_64-apple-darwin14))
ruby (tested with ruby 2.0.0p481 (2014-05-08 revision 45883) [universal.x86_64-darwin14])
rscript (tested with R scripting front-end version 3.1.2 (2014-10-31))
BAMMtools (R package; tested with v.2.0.6)
methods (R package; tested with 1.17.0)
coda (R package; tested with 0.17-1)

Input files in data directory:
outfiles/*.txt - input and output file of the SLOUCH analysis with the best-fitting model combination, produced as part of the S34_S38_phylogenetic_comparative_methods pipeline (these files are here required to generate input for analyses of the association between MHC I copy numbers and speciation)
tables/clades.txt - species richness for all phylogenetic clades used in our analysis (see file header for more information)
tables/order.txt - list specifying the order in which species will be plotted
trees/76g_nucl_conc_fossils.combined.tre - fossil-calibrated phylogenetic tree produced as part of the S15_S17_phylogenetic_inference pipeline
tables/regimes.txt - specification of node numbers for phylogenetic clades associated with shifts in the MHC I copy number optimum, as determined with the S34_S38_phylogenetic_comparative_methods pipeline
tables/species.txt - list translating species ids and names
templates/divcontrol.txt - input template for BAMM analyses
trees/76g_nucl_conc_fossils.combined.simple.ladder.tre - ladderized tree based on output of the S15_S17_phylogenetic_inference pipeline
trees/76g_nucl_conc_fossils.combined.pruned.tre - pruned version of phylogenetic tree based output of the S15_S17_phylogenetic_inference pipeline

Executing this pipeline:
cd [PATH]/S39_S40_diversification_rate_analyses/scripts
bash start.sh
