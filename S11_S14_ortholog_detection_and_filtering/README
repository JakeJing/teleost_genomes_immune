Notes:
Files in this directory demonstrate scripts and data used to generate a filtered alignment of 567 exon orthologs from 111 genes, as described in Supplementary Notes S11-S14.
For these scripts to run, tblastn databases will need to be created (with makeblastdb) on your system for all ctg.fasta files published as part of this study, plus the following genomes (for our study, these were downloaded from ENSEMBL v.78).
Astyanax_mexicanus.AstMex102.dna.toplevel.fa
Danio_rerio.Zv9.dna.toplevel.fa
Gadus_morhua.gadMor1.dna.toplevel.fa
Gasterosteus_aculeatus.BROADS1.dna.toplevel.fa
Oreochromis_niloticus.Orenil1.0.dna.toplevel.fa
Oryzias_latipes.MEDAKA1.dna.toplevel.fa
Poecilia_formosa.PoeFor_5.1.2.dna.toplevel.fa
Takifugu_rubripes.FUGU4.dna.toplevel.fa

Input files in data directory:
queries/nuclear/exons.fasta - file produced as part of the S10_S11_markers_for_phylogenetic_reconstruction pipeline
subjects/nuclear.txt - file listing the path to each of the tblastn databases on your system

Executing this pipeline:
cd [PATH]/S11_S14_ortholog_identification/scripts
bash start.sh
